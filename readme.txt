# Project Yoshiko

Yoshiko is a risk analysis software designed by Hayato Anton Gioro -- gioro.hayato@outlook.com started in 2023. 
The project is named after Yoshiko Kawashima, the legendary spymaster of the imperial Japanese Kwantung Army.

This model is dedicated to the industrial and fiancial sectors, it can identify potential risks, assess the 
likelihood and prepare for the impact of that specific threats at a faster and live pace. 

It will automatically prioritize the identified risks and develop relative mitigation strategies seemlessly 
without excessive human intervention.


## Methodlogy 

The machine learning models involved in Yoshiko are: 
1. Risk Matrices
2. Monte Carlo simulation
3. Decision trees
4. Fault Tree analysis
5. Event tree analysis
6. Bayesian networks
